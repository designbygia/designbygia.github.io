mission: "The Abalone project is a data tracking and analytics system aimed at storing and measuring data for population trends, mortality rates, and breeding programs. Designed as a multi-tenant application, Abalone will initially serve two stakeholders, the Bodega Marine Laboratory at UC Davis and the Puget Sound Restoration Fund in Washington State.

The Bodega Marine Laboratory's White Abalone captive breeding program is working to prevent the extinction of the White Abalone (Haliotis sorenseni), an endangered marine snail. White abalone are one of seven species found in California and are culturally significant to the native people of the area. White abalone were perilously overfished throughout the 20th century, resulting in a 99 percent population decrease by the end of the 1970s. This group is working to reverse their decline and have already seen some great success, they currently have more abalone in the lab than exist in the wild!

The Puget Sound Restoration Fund works to raise and outplant hatchery-reared Pinto Abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), the only abalone species found in the Washington waters. This species has cultural and ecological significance, grazing rock surfaces and maintaining the health of rocky reef habitat and kelp beds. The Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW) documented a ~98% decline from 1992 to 2017, leading the pinto abalone to be listed as a State endangered species in 2019."
built_by_rfg: "This application will enable groups to add data either through CSV upload or through the web interface. Groups can view reports and visual representations of key data. Future plans include giving groups the ability to generate custom reports on the fly."
scope_and_impact: "The abalone app will support Bodega Marine Laboratory and Puget Sound Restoration Fund keep White Abalone and Pinto Abalone from going extinct. "
